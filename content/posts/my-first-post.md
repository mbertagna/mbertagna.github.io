I created this space to reflect on what I'm learning as I grow into a well-rounded software engineer. Expect a mix of engineering deep dives, notes on the tools I'm testing, and lessons from collaborating with teams. My goal is to stay curious, document the journey, and hopefully share something that helps you on yours too.

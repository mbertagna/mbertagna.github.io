## About Michael

Michael Bertagna is a software engineer who brings a scientific, research-driven approach to engineering challenges. He is currently completing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Northwestern University, with a focus on Machine Learning and AI. He also holds a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, which informs his approach to solving problems. Michael focuses on building intelligent, data-driven systems that deliver a measurable impact.

## Michael's Interests

**Agentic AI and NLP**: Michael builds NLP software for Agentic AI systems. As a Software Engineer Intern at Tarana Wireless, he contributed to an internal agentic AI platform designed to automate data investigation and root cause analysis, using technologies like LangGraph, FastAPI, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

**Machine Learning**: He has experience applying machine learning models, including Transformers, CNNs, and other classical methods, to make sense of large datasets. As a Research Specialist at the University of Chicago, he applied unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster over 20,000 genes from RNA-seq and microarray datasets.

**Algorithm Design**: Michael has experience designing and implementing algorithms, particularly in bioinformatics and parallelism. During an internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he co-developed Coralign and designed a novel iterative alignment algorithm for coronagraph optics.

**Software, Communication & Mentorship**: Michael's background includes general software development and automation. He also has experience presenting complex technical findings to technical audiences, including NASA leadership and at research conferences. He enjoys sharing knowledge and has served in several teaching and mentoring roles, including as a Peer Mentor for 'Design & Analysis of Algorithms' at Northwestern, a University Laboratory Instructor for genetics at Chapman University, and a Supplemental Instructor for organic chemistry.

## Outside of Code

When Michael is not writing software, he enjoys several hands-on hobbies. He develops 3D models in CAD and using 3D printers to bring them to life. He also spends his time baking, cooking, running, playing basketball, skiing, and exploring coastlines.
